# Books-Sales-and-Ratings-SQL-
In this project, I analyzed a dataset obtained from Kaggle, namely, "The Books Dataset: Sales, Ratings, and Publication." This dataset offers extensive information about various aspects of books, encompassing their publishing year, author details, reader ratings, sales performance data, and genre classification.

The dataset contains multiple columns that provide different kinds of information:

Book Name: The title of each book.

Author: The name of the author who wrote the book.

language_code: The code representing the language in which the book is written.

Author_Rating: The rating assigned to the author based on their previous works.

Book_average_rating: The average rating given to the book by readers.

Book_ratings_count: The number of ratings given to the book by readers.

genre: The genre or category to which the book belongs.

gross sales: The total sales revenue generated by each book.

publisher revenue: The revenue earned by publishers from selling each book.

sale price: The price at which each copy of a book is sold.

sales rank: A numeric value indicating a book's rank based on its sales performance in comparison to other books within its category (genre).

units sold : Total number of copies sold for each specific title.
